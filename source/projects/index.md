# Munich projects

## Realtime interactions with web browsers

The [slides of Michael Macherey''s talk](http://slides.com/michaelmacherey/meteornunduino)  contain a general overview of the project, the Wii Nunchuck and the software based on Meteor and MongoDB.

The code is [at github](https://github.com/Goyapa/mongoduinometeor).

## Accelerometers with Bluetooth

[Thomas Sch√ºtt's project](http://www.roboshock.de/other/)

## RC car

Building a RC car [actually with Raspberry PI, but moving it to Arduino](http://www.raspberry-pi-car.com/)


## LEDlogics One

The goal of LEDlogics one is to have a simple "hello world" sandbox, that can be used with different micro controllers. You can find the design of the PCB here at [OSHpark](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/ZsQu0dA9). A first overview on light control can be found in this [blog post](http://blog.farsinotare.com/2014/07/25/lighting-design-overview/). (WIP by Patrick)
