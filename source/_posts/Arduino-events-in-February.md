In February, [IDEO](http://ideo.de) will host events about interaction design and IoT with [Massimo Banzi](http://www.massimobanzi.com/). You must sign up for the [IoT Arduino workshop](http://store.arduino.cc/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_code=WS00025).

Then, we have a visit from [Rheingold Heavy](http://rheingoldheavy.com/) who will introduce us to [I2C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C).

The preliminary talk outline is:

*  Introduction and origins of Rheingold Heavy
*  Turning code into electronic messages
*  Architecture of I2C
*  I2C Signaling Specifics
*  The Arduino Wire Library
*  Demo of ICs on the I2C shield

Also, there will possibly be an event with an application engineer from Infineon who will talk about their [motor and light control shields](http://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/promopages/Boards-for-Arduino/).
