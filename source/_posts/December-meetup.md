The X-mas hacking sessions began with fast food. "Fast", because we went straight into hacking.

Thomas showed his progress with the software behind his [Roboshock project](http://www.roboshock.de/), a bi-pedal robotics project. He has built an impressive UI to transform raw deta from different sensors into artificial "senses". Besides, he recently started on another project, a blood pressure sensor based on [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/).

At a different table, [Michael](https://twitter.com/goyapa) was working on [J5](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) for the [Arduino Yun](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardYun?from=Products.ArduinoYUN). While the Arduino community seems to be rather silent about this combination, there is a nice how-to of combining [Cylon.js with the Arduino Yun](http://cylonjs.com/documentation/platforms/yun/).

Next, Kresimir and me were working on a basic starter project: An Arduino based alarm clock. Since I forgot my DS1307 RTC chip, we "simulated" the time with counters on the Atmega328. A separate blog post on the clock will follow. At this point, it is maybe interesting to mention the [Tinyduino RTC shield](https://tiny-circuits.com/tiny-shield-rtc.html). 

Measuring time with an Arduino is rather easy, so, we progressed towards mounting an [old Nokia 5110 display](http://www.elecfreaks.com/5695.html) on an Arduino. This was great fun too, and is a topic for a different blog post too. By the way, if you are interested in professional Drone technologies, take a look at [Ascending Technologies](http://www.asctec.de/en/) where Kresi works.

Then, we had the pleasure to welcome [Martin Laarmann of the Munich Make team](http://make-munich.de/team/). After a great Make Munich 2014, Martin has started already preparing Make Munich 2015. Martin also mentioned the [Modularis](http://www.aevum-mechatronik.de/modularis/) board (made in Munich), and a hacking project to make dispenser machines more fun.
