The slides of the first talk on Arduino are [here](https://speakerdeck.com/mulderp/arduino-july-meetup).

An email list was created: arduino-muc@googlegroups.com - on the email list, we can maybe extend some of the discussions about shops, links, books, etc.


Agenda:

In this first meetup, a kick off ideas for Arduino meetups was presented, and some start with basic demos.

1) Welcome

2) Show and Tell:  Discuss your latest Arduino experiences and projects

3) Get ready Discuss/distribute parts, ordering of parts

4) Tinkering time: Form small teams and get to play with Arduino

If possible bring your own Arduino and parts. If you need something from the organizer, send me an email first: info@farsinotare.com.

What you need to get started, software, hardware, how to let LEDs blinks and measure temperature, how to use a potentiometer. 
Ideas are welcome to make the first meetup really fun.
