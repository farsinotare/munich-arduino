The Munich Arduino meetup is for electronic hackers in and around Munich, that want to explore physical computing, environmental monitoring, music, light, interactions and more.

We want to have a nice time by sharing and discussing ideas related to electronics and Arduino. The meetup can also help to network for building Arduino based products, or on finding a helping hand once in a while, when you are stuck.

Membership is free and open for everyone.

To support the meetup, you might want to join one or several hacker spaces in Munich (see [locations](/locations)).

We also want to play nicely with fellow meetups in Munich, such as:

* [IoT Munich](http://www.meetup.com/IoTMunich/)
* [Ultracode Munich](http://www.meetup.com/Ultracode-Munich/)
* [Munich Hardware.co](http://www.meetup.com/hardwaredotco-muenchen)
* [Munich Robots Enthusiasts](http://www.meetup.com/Munchen-robotics-enthusiasts/)
