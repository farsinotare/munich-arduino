The november meetup began rather quiet. The [MCSM](http://mcsm.divshot.io) hackerspace may be difficult to find, if you visit it the first time.  Yet, a really nice group of people finally found their way.

The first talk was given by [Andrey Nechypurenko](http://www.meetup.com/Munchen-robotics-enthusiasts/), organizer of the [Munich Robotics Enthusiasts](http://www.meetup.com/Munchen-robotics-enthusiasts/) meetup and maker of robots. Andrey impressively showed his experiments and developments of the [Veterobot](http://www.robotee.com/index.php/robot-projects/veterobot-project/) project.

While the robot's heart is a [Beagleboard](http://beagleboard.org/) from TI, a lot of topics relate to microcontrollers. For example, how do you talk with multiple sensors? (I2C.) How to manage electro magnetic radiation? How to control and compensate for differences of 4 wheels? A PID controller.

Besides the control challenages and computing questions, the project has solved a number of problems around 3D construction. Andrey mentioned that 3D design has its own challenges, and that 3D printers offer new opportunities to solve those.

More information of Andrey's project can be found here: [slides](http://bit.ly/1Ci8Uys)­and [on the website](http://veterobot.org).­

We had one more demo of a robot from [Jonathan Prince](https://twitter.com/greatsage). His robot was completely Arduino based, with a motor shield and some ultra sonic sensors.

A second talk was given by Thomas who is looking for new ways to raise healthy bee cultures. Munich has a large community of beekeepers. And Arduino might help here. Mites heavily threat bee cultures, and it would be nice to avoid chemical bombs to kill the mites. The slides from Thomas' presentation are [here](/assets/2014-11-24-arduino_bienen.pdf).

We discussed various ways how Arduino could control heat. This discussion sparked Carlos to show his latest experiments of Arduino based cooking.

After the talks, there was again some time for networking. Samuele showed photos of his Arduino powered X-mas tree from Italy last year. And Eymen and myself were hacking a bit the serial port for a bluetooth powered LED project. 

All in all, a very interesting meetup again.
